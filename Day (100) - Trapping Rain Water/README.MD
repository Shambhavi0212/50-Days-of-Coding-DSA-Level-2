🚀 Finally reached Day1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ of my 100 Days of Code Journey! 🎯  
Over the past 100 days, I mainly focused on **Java basics**, then moved on to **basic DSA problems**, with strong emphasis on **arrays** and **strings**, and less on set-based problems.  
This journey has been about building consistency, sharpening problem-solving skills, and understanding core programming logic step-by-step.  

🚀 Day1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣/100 : LeetCode 42 Challenge  

🧩 Problem Solved: Trapping Rain Water  
📊 Problem Type: Array | Two Arrays | Prefix/Suffix Max | Water Trapping Logic  

📝 Today, I:  
Solved the "Trapping Rain Water" problem from LeetCode, where I had to find the total amount of water trapped between bars of different heights after raining.  

📥 Example Input:  
[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]  
📤 Output: 6  

💡 Approach:  
1. Create `leftMax[]` array to store the highest bar on the left for each index  
2. Create `rightMax[]` array to store the highest bar on the right for each index  
3. For each position, trapped water = `min(leftMax[i], rightMax[i]) - height[i]`  
4. Sum up trapped water for all positions  

🛠️ Concepts Used:  
1. Arrays  
2. Prefix maximum & suffix maximum  
3. Math min/max functions  

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N)  
📦 Space Complexity: O(N)
