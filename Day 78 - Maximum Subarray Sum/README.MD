🚀 Day7️⃣8️⃣/100 : LeetCode 53 Challenge

🧩 Problem Solved: Maximum Subarray  
📊 Problem Type: Array | Kadane’s Algorithm | Dynamic Programming | Subarray Sum

📝 Today, I:  
Solved a classic dynamic programming problem from LeetCode, where the task was to find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum. This was efficiently solved using Kadane’s Algorithm in linear time.

📥 Example Input:  
[-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]  
📤 Output:  
6

💡 Approach:  
1. Initialize `currentsum` and `maxsum` with the first element  
2. Iterate through the array starting from index 1  
3. At each step, update `currentsum` as the maximum of current element and `currentsum + current element`  
4. Update `maxsum` if `currentsum` is greater than the current `maxsum`  
5. Return `maxsum` at the end

🛠️ Concepts Used:  
1. Kadane’s Algorithm  
2. Subarray sum logic  
3. Greedy/DP-style thinking

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N)  
📦 Space Complexity: O(1)
