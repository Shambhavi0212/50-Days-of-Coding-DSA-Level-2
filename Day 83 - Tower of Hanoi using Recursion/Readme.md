🚀 Day8️⃣3️⃣/100 : HackerRank CRT – Tower of Hanoi Challenge

🧩 Problem Solved: Tower of Hanoi  
📊 Problem Type: Recursion | Divide and Conquer | Backtracking | Simulation  

📝 Today, I:  
Solved the classic recursive Tower of Hanoi problem on HackerRank CRT, where the task was to print the sequence of steps to move `n` disks from source to destination using an auxiliary rod, following the puzzle’s rules.

📥 Example Input:  
2

📤 Output:  
Move disk 1 from A to B  
Move disk 2 from A to C  
Move disk 1 from B to C

💡 Approach:  
1. Use recursion to move `n-1` disks from source to auxiliary rod.  
2. Move the `nth` disk from source to destination.  
3. Recursively move the `n-1` disks from auxiliary to destination rod.  
4. Base case: when `n == 1`, print the move directly.

🛠️ Concepts Used:  
1. Recursion  
2. Stack-like call structure  
3. Problem decomposition (subproblem handling)  
4. Custom output formatting  

⏳ Time Complexity: O(2ⁿ − 1)  
📦 Space Complexity: O(n) (due to recursion stack)
