🧩 Problem Solved: Temperature Stability Checker for Product Storage  
📊 Problem Type: Arrays | Sorting | Min-Max Difference | Conditional Logic

📝 Today, I:  
Solved a simple yet practical CRTprep problem that checks whether product storage temperatures are within a stable range. Stability is defined by a variation of less than 15°C between the highest and lowest recorded temperatures.

📥 Example Input:
5  
10 -5 8 -9 6  

📤 Output:  
UNSTABLE

💡 Approach:
1. Read number of products and their temperatures using `Scanner`
2. Sort the temperature array
3. Get the min and max temperatures from the sorted array
4. Calculate the difference
5. If the difference < 15, print `"STABLE"` else `"UNSTABLE"`

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1. Array reading & sorting
2. Conditional check using ternary operator
3. Min-max logic

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N log N)  
📦 Space Complexity: O(N)
