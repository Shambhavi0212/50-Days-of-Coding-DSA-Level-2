🚀 Day4️⃣3️⃣/100 : HackerRank Closest Pair Challenge

🧩 Problem Solved: Find Closest Pair with Minimum Absolute Difference  
📊 Problem Type: Sorting | Pairwise Comparison | Array | Math

📝 Today, I:  
Solved a problem on HackerRank where I had to find a pair of integers from an array with the smallest absolute difference. If multiple such pairs existed, I had to return the smallest (lexicographically) one.

📥 Example Input:
5  
1 9 5 6 4  

📤 Output:
4 5  

💡 Approach:
1. Read the array using `Scanner`.
2. Sort the array to bring close numbers next to each other.
3. Iterate through the sorted array and compute pairwise absolute differences.
4. Track the pair with the smallest difference.
5. Print the pair in ascending order.

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1. Arrays  
2. Sorting  
3. Math.abs()  
4. Input/Output Handling  

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N log N) — due to sorting  
📦 Space Complexity: O(1) — no extra space except variables
