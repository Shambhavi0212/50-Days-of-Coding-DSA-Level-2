🚀 Day5️⃣1️⃣/100: CodeChef Challenge  

🧩 Problem Solved: DNA Storage  
📊 Problem Type: String | Mapping | Encoding | Implementation  

📝 Today, I:  
Solved a binary-to-DNA encoding problem from CodeChef, where each pair of binary digits is mapped to a nucleotide character using fixed logic (00 → A, 01 → T, 10 → C, 11 → G).

📥 Example Input:
4  
2  
00  
4  
0011  
6  
101010  
4  
1001  

📤 Output:
A  
AG  
CCC  
CT  

💡 Approach:
1. Read number of test cases using Scanner  
2. For each test case, read even-length binary string  
3. Iterate in steps of 2, forming 2-bit pairs  
4. Use if-else to map each pair to its corresponding DNA letter  
5. Append to result string and print

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1. String parsing  
2. Conditional logic  
3. Input/Output handling  
4. Character manipulation

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N) per test case  
📦 Space Complexity: O(1) auxiliary space
