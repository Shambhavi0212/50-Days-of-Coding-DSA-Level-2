🧩 Problem Solved: Longest Consecutive Subsequence  
📊 Problem Type: Arrays | Sorting | Logic | Consecutive Elements

📝 Today, I:  
Solved a medium-level problem from CRTPrep that required finding the length of the longest sequence of consecutive integers from an unsorted array.

📥 Example Input:
6  
100 4 200 1 3 2  

📤 Output:  
4  

💡 Approach:  
1. Read input using `Scanner`  
2. Handle edge case where input size is 0  
3. Sort the array  
4. Traverse the array to count consecutive increasing elements  
5. Use `Math.max` to store the maximum length found  
6. Skip duplicates during traversal  

🛠️ Concepts Used:  
1. Arrays  
2. Sorting using `Arrays.sort()`  
3. Input/Output handling  
4. Conditional logic  
5. Maximum tracking using `Math.max()`  

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N log N)  
📦 Space Complexity: O(1)
