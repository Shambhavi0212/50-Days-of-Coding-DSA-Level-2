🚀 Day6️⃣6️⃣/100 : HackerRank Challenge

🧩 Problem Solved: Separate Odd and Even Elements  
📊 Problem Type: Array | Conditional Logic | Input/Output

📝 Today, I:  
Solved a classification problem on HackerRank, where I had to separate integers into odd and even categories based on their values, maintaining the input order, and handling edge cases cleanly.

📥 Example Input:
6  
1 2 3 4 5 6

📤 Output:  
1 3 5  
2 4 6

💡 Approach:
1. Read input using `Scanner`
2. Traverse the array and separate elements into two arrays: `odd[]` and `even[]`
3. Use counters to track the number of odd and even elements
4. After traversal, check if either list is empty and handle accordingly
5. Print odd elements, then even elements

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1. Arrays
2. Input/Output handling in Java
3. If-else logic
4. Iteration with loops
5. Conditional checks for printing results

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N)  
📦 Space Complexity: O(N)
