🚀 Day9️⃣5️⃣/100 : LeetCode 75 Challenge  

🧩 Problem Solved: Sort Colors  
📊 Problem Type: Array | Sorting | Two Pointers | In-place Algorithm  

📝 Today, I:  
Solved the "Sort Colors" problem from LeetCode, where I had to arrange an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s in the order of red → white → blue without using any built-in sort function.  

📥 Example Input:  
[2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]  
📤 Output:  
[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]  

💡 Approach:  
1. Created a temporary array to store sorted elements.  
2. Added all 0s, then all 1s, and finally all 2s.  
3. Copied the sorted elements back to the original array.  

🛠️ Concepts Used:  
1. Arrays  
2. Looping through elements multiple times  
3. Basic sorting logic without built-in functions  

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N)  
📦 Space Complexity: O(N)
