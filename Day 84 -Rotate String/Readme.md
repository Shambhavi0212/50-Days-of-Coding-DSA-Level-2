🚀 Day8️⃣4️⃣/100 : LeetCode 796 Challenge 

🧩 Problem Solved: Rotate String  
📊 Problem Type: String | Rotation | Simulation  

📝 Today, I:  
Solved an interesting string manipulation problem from LeetCode, where I had to determine if one string can become another through a series of left rotations (moving the first character to the end repeatedly).  

📥 Example Input:  
s = "abcde"  
goal = "cdeab"  

📤 Output: true  

💡 Approach:  
1. If lengths of `s` and `goal` differ, return false  
2. Concatenate string `s` with itself → `s + s`  
3. Check if `goal` is a substring of the concatenated string  
4. Return true if yes, false otherwise  

🛠️ Concepts Used:  
1. String Concatenation  
2. Substring Search  
3. Basic Input Validation  

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N)  
📦 Space Complexity: O(N)
