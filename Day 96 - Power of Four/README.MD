🚀 Day9️⃣6️⃣/100 : LeetCode 342 Challenge  

🧩 Problem Solved: Power of Four  
📊 Problem Type: Math | Bit Manipulation | Loop  

📝 Today, I:  
Solved a problem from LeetCode where I had to determine if a given integer is a power of four.  

📥 Example Input:  
n = 16  
📤 Output:  
true  

💡 Approach:  
1. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, return false.  
2. While `n` is divisible by 4, keep dividing it by 4.  
3. If the final value is 1, it's a power of four; otherwise, it's not.  

🛠️ Concepts Used:  
1. Loops  
2. Modulus operation  
3. Basic number theory  

⏳ Time Complexity: O(log₄N)  
📦 Space Complexity: O(1)
