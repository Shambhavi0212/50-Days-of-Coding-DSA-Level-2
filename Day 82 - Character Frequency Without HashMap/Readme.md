🚀 Day8️⃣2️⃣/100 : HackerRank CRT Challenge

🧩 Problem Solved: Frequency of Characters in a String  
📊 Problem Type: Strings | Frequency Count | ASCII | Basic Logic

📝 Today, I:
Solved a character frequency problem on HackerRank CRT, where I had to count how many times each character occurs in a string without using any Java collections like `HashMap`.

📥 Sample Input:
banana

📤 Output:
b 1  
a 3  
n 2

💡 Approach:
1. Read the input string using `Scanner`
2. Create a frequency array of size 255 to track each character (based on ASCII)
3. Loop through the string to update character counts
4. Use another boolean array to ensure each character is printed only once (in order of appearance)
5. Print each character with its frequency

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1. Character arrays & ASCII values  
2. Basic I/O in Java  
3. Boolean flags for tracking  
4. Looping logic for unique output

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N)  
📦 Space Complexity: O(1) (since array size is constant 255)
