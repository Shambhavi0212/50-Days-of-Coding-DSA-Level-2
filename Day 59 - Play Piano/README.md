🚀 Day5️⃣9️⃣/100 : CodeChef Challenge  

🧩 Problem Solved: Play Piano  
📊 Problem Type: String | Validation | Simulation  

📝 Today, I:  
Solved a string validation problem from CodeChef where I had to check if a log of piano plays could be valid, ensuring two sisters (A and B) each played exactly once per day in any order.  

📥 Example Input:  
4  
AB  
ABBA  
ABAABB  
AA  

📤 Output:  
yes  
yes  
no  
no  

💡 Approach:  
1️⃣ Read number of test cases and log strings using Scanner  
2️⃣ Iterate through the string in pairs (each representing one day)  
3️⃣ If any pair contains the same character (AA or BB), mark as invalid  
4️⃣ Print `yes` if all pairs are valid; otherwise, `no`  

🛠️ Concepts Used:  
1️⃣ String manipulation  
2️⃣ Looping with steps  
3️⃣ Conditional checks  

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N)per test case  
📦 Space Complexity: O(1)
