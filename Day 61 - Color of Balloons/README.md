🧩 Problem Solved: Malvika is peculiar about color of balloons  
📊 Problem Type: String | Counting | Greedy  

📝 Today, I:
Solved a string-based problem from CodeChef where I had to determine the minimum number of balloon color flips required so that all balloons are of the same color (amber or brass).

📥 Example Input:
3  
ab  
bb  
baaba  

📤 Output:
1  
0  
2  

💡 Approach:
1. Read number of test cases using `Scanner`.
2. For each test case, read the string and count number of `a` (amber) and `b` (brass).
3. The minimum flips needed is the smaller of the two counts.
4. Print the result for each test case.

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1. String traversal
2. Counting frequency of characters
3. Greedy logic to minimize flips
4. Input/Output handling

⏳ Time Complexity: O(T*N) where T is the number of test cases and N is the string length  
📦 Space Complexity: O(1) (constant extra space, ignoring input storage)
