🧩 Problem Solved: Count the Digits That Divide a Number  
📊 Problem Type: Math | Number Manipulation | Basic Loop

📝 Today, I:  
Solved a number manipulation problem from LeetCode where I had to count how many digits of a number divide the number itself.

📥 Example Input:
num = 1248  
📤 Output: 4

💡 Approach:
1. Store the original number in a separate variable.
2. Loop through each digit using modulo and division.
3. For every digit, check if it divides the original number using `num % digit == 0`.
4. Count such digits.
5. Return the final count.

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1. Integer division and modulo
2. While loop and digit extraction
3. Condition checking

⏳ Time Complexity: O(log₁₀N)  
📦 Space Complexity: O(1)
