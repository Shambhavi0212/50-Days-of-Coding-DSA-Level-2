The box model in CSS is a fundamental concept that describes how elements are rendered and how their dimensions and spacing are calculated.
It is essential for understanding how elements are displayed on a web page.

The box model consists of four main components:

Content: This is the actual content of the element, such as text, images, or other HTML elements
Padding: The padding is the space between the content and the border. It provides a buffer area around the content, inside the element. Padding can be set using CSS properties like 'padding-top', 'padding-right', 'padding-bottom', and 'padding-left'
Border: The border surrounds the padding and content and defines the visible boundary of the element. It can be styled using properties like 'border-width', 'border-style', and 'border-color'
Margin: The margin is the space between the border of an element and the surrounding elements. It creates a gap or separation between elements.
Margins can be set using properties like 'margin-top', 'margin-right', 'margin-bottom', and 'margin-left'.
