🧩 Problem Solved: Product of Digits of Even Numbers  
📊 Problem Type: Array | Digits | Even Numbers | Edge Cases  

📝 Today, I:  
Solved an interesting array problem from HackerRank where I had to extract all even numbers from the array and compute the **product of their digits**, printing them in order. If no even numbers were present, the output should be a clear message.

📥 Example Input:
5  
122 91 174 99 1204  

📤 Output:  
4 28 0  

💡 Approach:
1. Read array size and elements using Scanner  
2. Identify and store even numbers in a separate array  
3. For each even number:
   - Extract each digit
   - Calculate the product of all digits  
4. Print the products in order  
5. If no even numbers exist, print "No Even Elements"

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1. Arrays  
2. Input Handling  
3. Digit Extraction  
4. Edge Case Handling  

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N × D), where D is the number of digits  
📦 Space Complexity: O(N), for storing even numbers
