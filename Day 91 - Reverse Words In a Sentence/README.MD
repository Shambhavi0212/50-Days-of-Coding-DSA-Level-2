🚀 Day9️⃣1️⃣/100 : Manual Java Challenge

🧩 Problem Solved: Reverse the Words in a Sentence  
📊 Problem Type: String | Word Manipulation | Input/Output | Basic Logic

📝 Today, I:  
Solved a simple string-based problem in Java where I reversed the order of words in a given sentence (without reversing the characters inside each word).

📥 Example Input:  
I love Java programming  

📤 Output:  
programming Java love I  

💡 Approach:
1. Take full sentence input using `Scanner`
2. Split the sentence into words using `.split(" ")`
3. Traverse the array of words in reverse order
4. Print each word with a space

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1. String splitting
2. Arrays
3. For loop in reverse
4. Scanner input handling

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N) — where N is number of words  
📦 Space Complexity: O(N) — to store words in an array
