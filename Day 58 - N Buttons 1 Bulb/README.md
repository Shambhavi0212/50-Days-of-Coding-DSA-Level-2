🚀 Day5️⃣8️⃣/100 : CodeChef Challenge  

🧩 Problem Solved: N Buttons 1 Bulb  
📊 Problem Type: Strings | Bit Manipulation | Basic Logic  

📝 Today, I:  
Solved an interesting problem from CodeChef where the task was to determine the final state of a bulb after toggling buttons. The bulb toggles its state each time a button's state changes.  

📥 Example Input:  
2  
3  
000  
001  
2  
00  
11  

📤 Output:  
0  
1  

💡 Approach:  
1️⃣ Read inputs using Scanner (T test cases, N, S, R).  
2️⃣ For each test case, compare S and R character by character.  
3️⃣ Count how many buttons changed state (mismatches).  
4️⃣ If the count of changes is even, the bulb remains on; if odd, it turns off.  
5️⃣ Print `1` for ON, `0` for OFF.  

🛠️ Concepts Used:  
1. String comparison  
2. Input/Output handling  
3. Basic counting logic  

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N) per test case  
📦 Space Complexity: O(1)
