🚀 Day9️⃣8️⃣/100 : LeetCode 41 Challenge  

🧩 Problem Solved: First Missing Positive  
📊 Problem Type: Array | Sorting | Searching  

📝 Today, I:  
Solved the "First Missing Positive" problem from LeetCode, where I had to find the smallest positive integer not present in the given unsorted integer array.  

📥 Example Input:  
[3,4,-1,1]  
📤 Output: 2  

💡 Approach:  
1. Sort the array using `Arrays.sort()`  
2. Initialize a variable `smallest` as 1 (the smallest positive integer to check)  
3. Traverse the array, and whenever `nums[i]` matches `smallest`, increment `smallest` by 1  
4. Return `smallest` at the end  

🛠️ Concepts Used:  
1. Array traversal  
2. Sorting  
3. Conditional checks  

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N log N) (due to sorting)  
📦 Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sort)
