🧩 Problem Solved: Add One  
📊 Problem Type: String Manipulation | BigInteger | Input/Output  

📝 Today, I:  
Solved a problem where I had to add one to a very large number that cannot fit in standard integer data types. I used Java's `BigInteger` class to handle the large number addition.  

📥 Example Input:
6  
99  
17  
1  
599  
10000000000000000000  
549843954323494990404  

📤 Example Output:
100  
18  
2  
600  
10000000000000000001  
549843954323494990405  

💡 Approach:
1️⃣ Read the number of test cases using `Scanner`.  
2️⃣ For each test case, read the large number as a `String`.  
3️⃣ Convert the string to `BigInteger` and add 1.  
4️⃣ Print the result.  

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1. BigInteger for handling very large numbers  
2. String input parsing  
3. Simple arithmetic operation with BigInteger  

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N) per test case, where N is the number of digits  
📦 Space Complexity: O(N)
