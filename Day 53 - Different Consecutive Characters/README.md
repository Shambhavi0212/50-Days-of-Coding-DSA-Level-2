🚀 Day5️⃣3️⃣/100 : CodeChef Challenge  

🧩 Problem Solved: Different Consecutive Characters  
📊 Problem Type: Greedy | String | Basic Counting  

📝 Today, I:  
Solved a binary string manipulation problem from CodeChef, where the goal was to ensure no two consecutive characters in the string are the same. The allowed operation was to insert characters (0 or 1) at any position to break such consecutive repetitions...

📥 Example Input:
3  
2  
11  
4  
0101  
5  
00100  

📤 Output:
1  
0  
2  

💡 Approach:
1. Loop through each test case.
2. For each binary string, count how many times two consecutive characters are the same.
3. Each such pair requires one insertion to break the sequence.
4. Print the total insertions needed for each test case.

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1. Strings  
2. Greedy traversal  
3. Character comparison  
4. Looping logic  

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N) per test case  
📦 Space Complexity: O(1) (ignoring input storage)
