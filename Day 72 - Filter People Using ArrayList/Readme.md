🧩 Problem Solved: Filter People Over Age 25  
📊 Problem Type: ArrayList | Objects | Classes | Filtering Logic  

📝 Today, I:  
Practiced using an `ArrayList` of custom objects in Java. I created a `Person` class with `name` and `age` attributes, added 3 people to the list, and printed only the names of people whose age is greater than 25.

📥 Problem Statement:

1. Create an ArrayList to store objects representing people.
2. Each person object should have a name (String) and an age (int).
3. Add 3 people to the ArrayList.
4. Print out the names of all people in the ArrayList who are over the age of 25.


📤 Sample Output:
People over the age of 25:
Alice
Charlie

💡 Approach:
1. Defined a `Person` class with `name` and `age` attributes and appropriate getter methods.
2. Created an `ArrayList<Person>`.
3. Added 3 people using the constructor.
4. Used a for-each loop to iterate over the list.
5. Printed names where age > 25.

🛠️ Concepts Used:
- Classes and Objects  
- ArrayList of Objects  
- Encapsulation using Getters  
- Loops and Conditional Statements  

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N)
