🚀 Day9️⃣3️⃣/100 : LeetCode 14 Challenge 

🧩 Problem Solved: Longest Common Prefix  
📊 Problem Type: Strings | Prefix Matching | Array of Strings

📝 Today, I:  
Solved a string problem from LeetCode where I had to find the **longest common prefix** among an array of strings. It helped strengthen my understanding of how to compare characters across multiple strings in sequence.

📥 Example Input:  
["flower", "flow", "flight"]

📤 Output:  
"fl"

💡 Approach:  
1. Assume the first string as the initial prefix  
2. Loop through the rest of the strings  
3. Gradually trim the prefix if the current string doesn’t start with it  
4. Return the final prefix once all strings are processed

🛠️ Concepts Used:  
1. String comparison  
2. Prefix checking using `startsWith()`  
3. Iteration and trimming logic  

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N * M)  
📦 Space Complexity: O(1)
