🚀 Day6️⃣9️⃣/100 : HackerRank Challenge 

🧩 Problem Solved: Sum of Absolute Differences  
📊 Problem Type: Arrays | Math | Input/Output | Absolute Difference

📝 Today, I:  
Solved a HackerRank problem that required computing the total of absolute differences between every pair of adjacent elements in an array. A simple yet elegant problem focusing on difference calculation and array traversal.

📥 Sample Input:
4  
2 4 1 3  

📤 Output:  
7

💡 Approach:
1. Read the size of the array `n`
2. Read `n` integers into an array
3. Traverse from index 0 to n-2
4. For each pair `(a[i], a[i+1])`, compute `abs(a[i+1] - a[i])`
5. Accumulate the result and print the final sum

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1. Arrays
2. Absolute Value Calculation
3. Looping and Index Logic
4. Input/Output with Scanner

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N)  
📦 Space Complexity: O(N)
