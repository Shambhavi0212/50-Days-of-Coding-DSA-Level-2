🚀 Day8️⃣9️⃣/100 : String Compression Challenge

🧩 Problem Solved: Compress the String  
📊 Problem Type: String | Character Counting | Basic Logic

📝 Today, I:  
Solved a manual string manipulation problem in Java, where I had to compress a given string by replacing groups of the same character with the character followed by its frequency.

📥 Example Input:  
aabbccc

📤 Output:  
a2b2c3

💡 Approach:
1. Read the string input using Scanner  
2. Loop through the string starting from the 1st character  
3. Count how many times a character repeats consecutively  
4. Append the character and its count to the result string  
5. Print the final compressed string

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1. String Traversal  
2. Character Comparison  
3. Counting Repeats  
4. String Concatenation

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N)  
📦 Space Complexity: O(N) (for the result string)
