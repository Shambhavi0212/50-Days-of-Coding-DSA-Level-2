🚀 Day9️⃣0️⃣/100 : Substring Generator from String ✂️

🧩 Problem Solved: Print All Substrings  
📊 Problem Type: String | Substrings | Nested Loops | Basic Manipulation  

📝 Today, I:  
Solved a fundamental yet essential problem that involved printing **all possible substrings** of a given lowercase string. This problem improves understanding of nested loops and the `substring()` method in Java.

📥 Sample Input:  
abc
📤 Output:
a  
ab  
abc  
b  
bc  
c  

💡 Approach:
1. Read the input string using `Scanner`
2. Use two nested loops:
   - Outer loop: start index of substring
   - Inner loop: end index of substring (exclusive)
3. Print every valid substring using `s.substring(i, j)`

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1. Java Strings and Substrings  
2. Nested Loops  
3. Input Handling with Scanner  
4. Time and Space Complexity Basics

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N²)  
📦 Space Complexity: O(1) (excluding output space)
