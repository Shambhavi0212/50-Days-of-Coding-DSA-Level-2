🧩 Problem Solved: Convert String to Title Case  
📊 Problem Type: String Manipulation | Title Case | Acronym Handling

📝 Today, I:  
Solved a practical string manipulation problem where I had to convert each input string into title case. The twist was that acronyms (entirely uppercase words) must remain unchanged, while all other words follow the title casing rule.

📥 Example Input:
5  
hello world  
this is a CODECHEF problem  
WELCOME to the JUNGLE  
the quick BROWN fOx  
programming in PYTHON  

📤 Output:
Hello World  
This Is A CODECHEF Problem  
WELCOME To The JUNGLE  
The Quick BROWN Fox  
Programming In PYTHON  

💡 Approach:
1. Read number of test cases and strings using `Scanner`
2. Split each string by spaces into words
3. For each word, check if it's an acronym (i.e., all uppercase)
4. If it's an acronym, keep it as is; otherwise, convert it to title case
5. Join the words with space and print the result

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1. String Splitting
2. Character Case Conversion
3. StringBuilder for efficient concatenation
4. Conditionals for acronym detection

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N) per string  
📦 Space Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the string
