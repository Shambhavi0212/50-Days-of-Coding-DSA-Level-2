🚀 Day7️⃣1️⃣/100 - ArrayList Exploration: Loops & Clear Method

🧩 Problem Practiced: Iteration and Clearing Practice with an Integer List  
📊 Problem Type: ArrayList | Iteration | Data Structure Methods | Java Collections

📝 Today, I:
Practiced two important aspects of Java's ArrayList:
1. Iterating over elements using both regular `for` loop and enhanced `for-each` loop.
2. Clearing the entire list using `.clear()` and verifying its state using `.isEmpty()`.

📥 Example Input:
4  
10 20 30 40

📤 Output:
10  
20  
30  
40  
10  
20  
30  
40  
true

💡 Approach:
1. Read an integer `n` followed by `n` space-separated integers.
2. Store them in an `ArrayList<Integer>`.
3. Traverse the list using both `for` and `for-each` loop.
4. Clear the list with `.clear()` and check if it's empty with `.isEmpty()`.

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1. ArrayList Traversal  
2. Java Collections API  
3. Looping Techniques  
4. Built-in List Methods
