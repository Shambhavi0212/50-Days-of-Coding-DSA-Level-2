🧩 Problem Solved: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array  
📊 Problem Type: Two Pointers | Array | In-place Modification | Sorted Array

📝 Today, I:  
Solved a classic problem on removing duplicates in-place from a sorted array using the two-pointer technique on LeetCode. The challenge was to return the number of unique elements while modifying the array without using extra space.

📥 Example Input:  
[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]  

📤 Output:  
5, Modified Array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, _, _, _, _, _]  

💡 Approach:  
1. Initialize a `write` pointer at index 1.  
2. Traverse the array with a `read` pointer starting from index 1.  
3. If current element `!=` previous element, copy it to `nums[write]` and increment `write`.  
4. Return `write` as the count of unique elements.

🛠️ Concepts Used:  
1. Arrays  
2. Two Pointers  
3. In-place Updates  
4. Efficient Index Management  

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N)  
📦 Space Complexity: O(1)
