🚀 Day5️⃣7️⃣/100 : CodeChef Challenge 

🧩 Problem Solved: Chef and Happy String  
📊 Problem Type: String | Substring | Vowel Check | Basic Logic  

📝 Today, I:  
Solved a string problem from CodeChef where I had to determine if a string contains a contiguous substring of length > 2 that consists of only vowels.  

📥 Example Input:  
4  
aeiou  
abxy  
aebcdefghij  
abcdeeafg  

📤 Output:  
Happy  
Sad  
Sad  
Happy  

💡 Approach:  
1️⃣ Read input using `Scanner` for multiple test cases  
2️⃣ Iterate through each character of the string  
3️⃣ Maintain a counter for consecutive vowels  
4️⃣ If counter reaches 3, break early as Chef is happy  
5️⃣ Reset counter when a consonant is found  
6️⃣ Print "Happy" if counter > 2, else "Sad"  

🛠️ Concepts Used:  
✅ String traversal  
✅ Character comparison  
✅ Basic condition checks  

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N) per test case  
📦 Space Complexity: O(1)
