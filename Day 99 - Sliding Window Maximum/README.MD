🚀 Day9️⃣9️⃣/100 : LeetCode 239 Challenge  

🧩 Problem Solved: Sliding Window Maximum  
📊 Problem Type: Array | Sliding Window | Brute Force  

📝 Today, I:  
Solved the classic "Sliding Window Maximum" problem from LeetCode. The task was to find the maximum value in each sliding window of size `k` as it moves across the array. I implemented a simple brute force solution for clarity before exploring optimized approaches.  

📥 Example Input:  
nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3  

📤 Output:  
[3,3,5,5,6,7]  

💡 Approach:  
1. Loop through each starting index of the window  
2. For each window, iterate through `k` elements and find the maximum  
3. Store the maximum in the result array  

🛠️ Concepts Used:  
1. Arrays  
2. Nested loops  
3. Basic maximum value tracking  

⏳ Time Complexity: O(N × K)  
📦 Space Complexity: O(N - K + 1)
