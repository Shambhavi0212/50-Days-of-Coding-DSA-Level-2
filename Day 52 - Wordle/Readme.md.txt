🚀 Day5️⃣2️⃣/50 : CodeChef Challenge 

🧩 Problem Solved: Wordle - Modified Version  
📊 Problem Type: String Matching | Character Comparison | Input/Output  

📝 Today, I:  
Solved a fun and logical problem inspired by the game Wordle, where I had to compare a hidden word with a guessed word and generate a result string showing correctness at each position using 'G' (Green) and 'B' (Black).

📥 Example Input:
3  
ABCDE  
EDCBA  
ROUND  
RINGS  
START  
STUNT  

📤 Output:  
BBGBB  
GBBBB  
GGBBG  

💡 Approach:
1. Read number of test cases `T`
2. For each test case, read two strings `S` and `T` of length 5
3. For each character, compare `S[i]` with `T[i]`
4. If matched, append 'G' to result, else append 'B'
5. Print the result string for each test case

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1. String comparison  
2. Loops  
3. Character indexing  
4. Java Input/Output handling  

⏳ Time Complexity: O(T*5)  
📦 Space Complexity: O(1) (excluding output strings)
