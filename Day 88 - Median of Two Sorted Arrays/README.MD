🚀 Day8️⃣8️⃣/100 : LeetCode 4 Challenge

🧩 Problem Solved: Median of Two Sorted Arrays  
📊 Problem Type: Binary Search | Divide and Conquer | Array | Sorting  

📝 Today, I:  
Solved a classic hard-level LeetCode problem where I merged two sorted arrays and computed the median value of the resulting array.

📥 Example Input:
nums1 = [1, 3], nums2 = [2]

📤 Output:
2.00000

💡 Approach:
1. Combine both arrays into a single array.
2. Sort the merged array.
3. If the total length is even, take the average of the two middle elements.
4. If it's odd, return the middle element.

🛠️ Concepts Used:
1. Array merging
2. Sorting using `Arrays.sort()`
3. Median calculation
4. Conditional logic

⏳ Time Complexity: O((m+n) log(m+n)) – due to sorting  
📦 Space Complexity: O(m + n) – for merged array
