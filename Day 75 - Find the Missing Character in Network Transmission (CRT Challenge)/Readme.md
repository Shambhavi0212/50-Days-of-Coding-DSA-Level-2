🚀 Day7️⃣4️⃣/100 : CRT Weekly Challenge

🧩 Problem Solved: Find the Missing Character in Network Transmission  
📊 Problem Type: Strings | Character Difference | Input/Output | Debugging  

📝 Today, I:  
Solved a network-related character mismatch detection problem from CRT weekly challenge. The task was to identify the single missing character from a sent string by comparing it to the received string which had exactly one character lost during transmission.

📥 Example Input:
helloworld  
helloworl  

📤 Output:  
d  

💡 Approach:  
1. Read both strings using `Scanner`  
2. If both strings have equal length, print `"No Missing Character"`  
3. Else, compute ASCII sum of both strings  
4. The difference between the sums gives the missing character’s ASCII  
5. Convert the difference to character and print it  

🛠️ Concepts Used:  
1. Strings and ASCII values  
2. Character arithmetic  
3. Conditional checks and loops  

⏳ Time Complexity:O(N)  
📦 Space Complexity:O(1)
