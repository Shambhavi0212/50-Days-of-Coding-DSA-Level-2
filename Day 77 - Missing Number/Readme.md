🚀 Day7️⃣7️⃣/100 : LeetCode Challenge  

🧩 Problem Solved: LeetCode 268 - Missing Number  
📊 Problem Type: Array | Math | Bit Manipulation | Cyclic Sort  

📝 Today, I:  
Solved the **"Missing Number"** problem from **LeetCode (Problem 268)**, which involves finding the only number missing from an array that contains `n` distinct numbers from the range `[0, n]`.

📥 Example Input:  
[3, 0, 1]  
📤 Output:  
2  

💡 Approach:  
1. The expected sum of numbers from 0 to n is calculated using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`.  
2. The actual sum of elements in the array is computed using a loop.  
3. Subtracting the actual sum from the expected sum gives the missing number.

🛠️ Concepts Used:  
1. Arithmetic Series Formula  
2. Arrays  
3. Looping through Arrays  
4. Difference Logic  

⏳ Time Complexity: O(n)  
📦 Space Complexity: O(1)
